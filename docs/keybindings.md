# Keybindings

## Introduction

To enable fluent developement in nvim and vscode (with neovim integration) all keybindings are equal. Small differences caused by different ui concepts are marked under the note column.

The bindings can have the following status:

- b for implemented in both environments
- v for currently in nvim only
- c for currently in vscode only
- m for missing in both
